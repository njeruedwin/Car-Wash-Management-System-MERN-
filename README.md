Ayee My friends,
Thank you for having intrest in my repository.
This is a car wash management system that allows clients to be able to check the status of their cars after they have been delivered at the car wash.
It allows the owners of the car wash to also keep a registry of the cars passing through their car wash, and also provide the information to their clients that their respective cars are ready for pickup.
Clients are able to enter their plate numbers and their car status is indicated ( 'Ready' , 'Not Ready', and 'You do not have a car at the Car Wash, check plate number again' if the car does not exist or the wrong plate number is entered )
